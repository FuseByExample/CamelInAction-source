Introduction
------------

This sub-project implements the code examples of Camel in Action - Appendix E
(http://www.manning.com/ibsen/appEsample.pdf). The examples are based on Akka
1.0 and Camel 2.5.0.

Maintainance
------------

An updated version of the examples, that work with later Akka releases and the
latest Akka development snapshot, are maintained at

http://github.com/krasserm/camelinaction-appendix-e

Prerequisites
-------------

Building and running the examples requires SBT [1], a simple build tool
for Scala projects. Installation instructions can be found at [2]. After
installation, you should have the 'sbt' command available.

Build examples
--------------

To build the examples, go to the appendixE directory and run

sbt update
sbt compile

from the command line. The first command downloads all necessary dependencies,
the second command compiles the sources.

Run examples
------------

To run one of the examples, run

sbt run

from the command line. This will display a list of main classes. The classes
are named based on the section numbers in appendix E. Here's an example:

 [1] camelinaction.SectionE2
 [2] camelinaction.SectionE31
 [3] camelinaction.SectionE32
 [4] camelinaction.SectionE4
 [5] camelinaction.SectionE52
 [6] camelinaction.SectionE6
 [7] camelinaction.SectionE7

To run the examples from section 3.1, enter 2 when prompted.
