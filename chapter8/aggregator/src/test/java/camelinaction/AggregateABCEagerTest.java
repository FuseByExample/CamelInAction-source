/**
 * The ABC example for using the Aggregator EIP.
 * <p/>
 * This example have 4 messages send to the aggregator, by which one
 * message is published which contains the aggregation of message 1,2 and 4
 * as they use the same correlation key.
 * <p/>
 * This time we use the completionPredicate to know when the END message arrives
 * and thus triggers completion. Notice how we use the eagerCheckCompletion which
 * cause the completionPredicate to have the arriving Exchange as input. If we <b>did not</b>
 * do that then the completionPredicate will have the aggregated Exchange as input.
 * <p/>
 * See the class {@link MyEndAggregationStrategy} for how the messages
 * are actually aggregated together. Notice how this class will discard the END message.
