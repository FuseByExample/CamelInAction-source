/**
 * The ABC example for using persistent Aggregator EIP.
 * <p/>
 * The test runs for 20 seconds where you can copy files to target/inbox folder.
 * This files are picked up and aggregated. Every 3th file triggers completion.
 * <p/>
 * You can let the test terminate by waiting until it stops. Then start it again
 * so you can continue. For example copy 1 files and wait for the test to stop.
 * Then start the test and copy 2 files, to see that it triggers a completion.
